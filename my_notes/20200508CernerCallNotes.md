Plan A: Merged resource. Drew's going to kick this off.
Plan B: consensus; could get on board with Group.

Group give ability to search by characteristics,  but is references by other resource as subject or target in spec so need to be aware of concept of groups that can be reference vs those that are not intended to be referenced.

If use list need to use code + some value to get the List

Dynamically created lists of Patients vs Retrieval of static lists:
  Is the really just a semantic difference and the behavior on the back end is the same and does it matter?
  Can the transaction be the same or does it have to be for example an operation for one and a RESTful Search for the other.

Narrow down the use cases

 is active patient to broad or just need to define what means
