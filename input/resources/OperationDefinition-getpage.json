    "description": "The Group resources can contain a lot of members and make dealing with them as a whole hard for a client.  To work around this issue, the  `$getpage` operation returns a List or Group with just a subset of its members. It is an instance level operation that uses the input parameters `offset` and `count` to specify the subset.",
