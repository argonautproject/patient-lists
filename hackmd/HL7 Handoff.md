# HL7 Handoff

The Argonaut steering committee has indicated that this project should become an HL7 implementation guide when there is sufficient user experience and testing. to facilitate this transition, an [HL7 Project Proposal](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/PSS-1679?src=confmacro) and [HL7 Project Scope Statement](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/AP/Argonaut+Patient+List+Project) have been created. The HL7 Patient Administration WorkGroup sponsorship and co-sponsoship by other HL7 WorkGroups has been secured.  No firm roadmap for publishing a specification has been established.
